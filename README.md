# Deep Learning with Tensorflow for Artificial Neural Networks:

In this repo, I am going to share Code Implemetation for Developing Artificial Neural Networks Using Tensorflow


### Topics covered 

        - Checking Gpu Availability
        - Training Data and Testing Data 
        - Creating Inputs as Dimensions 
        - Creating Hidden Layers 
        - Activation Functions 
        - Output Layers 
        - Difference in sigmoid and Softmax Activation Functions
        - Back Propagation 
        - Updating weights 
        - Training ANN Model and Testing Model 
        - Validating Model 
        - Predictions with test Data and Real Data 
        - Saving the Model



#### First we need to check our data should be in structured Format and also Data should be cleaned which means there should be no Missing values and Entire concepts which comes under Feature Engineering Part:

### Difference between ANN and CNN concepts:

ANN works with structured data like with csv files are also with any array format data which is in rows and columns format But when comes to CNN it works with Unstructured Data Like Images and Videos.
You can check the step-by-step code Implemetation in the Above jupyter notebook.
